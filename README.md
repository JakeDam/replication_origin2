# Replication Origin 2
## Coding Challenges from UCSD's Bioinformatics I Week 2

Python script that contains tools for analyzing the repilication origin of genomes:
- skew: Determines the skew (difference between C and G) at all points of a genome
- minimum_skew: Determines the points in the genome with the lowest skew value
- hamming_dist: Calculates the Hamming Distance between two nucleotide sequences
- approximate_match: Determines the location of approximate (within a certian number of bases) matches of a pattern to a genome
- approximate_pattern_count: Counts the number of approximate matches of a pattern to a genome
